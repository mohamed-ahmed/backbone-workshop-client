           cold? Freezing? KEEP
             ~YOURSELF WARM~
                with a
            s0othing CHIMNEY
                      that
                        â€˜consumes
                            your
                              logs'.
    
                            -- WHAT -
      ANSI escape sequence animation of
      an ASCII fire which intensity is
      modulated by the amount of
      (console) logs you feed into it.
      
                            -- HOW --
      You could set up your chimney with
      npm by doing:
      
      $ npm install -g chimney
      
      And then just go to your project,
      and type:
      
      $ chimney path/to/your/files
    
                            -- WAIT --
      Add a chimney to your build process
      to burn the logs before you minify.

      chimney = require('chimney');

      chimney.removeLogsForEachFiles(
        function('.', function(code) {

          // code is stripped from any
          // logs.
        });
      );
